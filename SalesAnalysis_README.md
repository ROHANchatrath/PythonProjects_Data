We utilize Python Pandas and Python Matplotlib for examining and responding to business queries concerning 12 months of sales data. The dataset comprises hundreds of thousands of electronics store transactions categorized by month, product type, cost, purchase address, and more.

Our initial step involves data cleansing:

Removing NaN values from the DataFrame
Filtering rows based on specified conditions
Adjusting column types using methods like to_numeric, to_datetime, and astype

Once the data is refined, we proceed to the data exploration section. Here, we address five high-level business questions related to our data:

What was the best month for sales, and how much was earned that month?
Which city sold the most products?
What is the optimal time for displaying advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customer purchases?
Which products are frequently sold together?
Which product sold the most, and why do you think it sold the most?

To answer these questions, we employ various Pandas and Matplotlib methods, including:

Concatenating multiple CSV files to create a new DataFrame using pd.concat
Adding columns
Parsing cells as strings to create new columns (.str)
Using the .apply() method
Employing groupby for aggregate analysis
Plotting bar charts and line graphs to visualize results
Labeling our graphs for clarity
