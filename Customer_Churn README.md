Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction

Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn in a telecommunications company. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers cease their relationship with a company. By understanding the factors that contribute to churn and building predictive models, businesses can take proactive measures to retain customers.

Data Source
The dataset used for this project can be found here.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase involves exploring the dataset to gain insights into the underlying patterns and relationships. Key steps in the EDA process include:

Data Loading and Understanding: Understand the structure and content of the dataset.
Univariate Analysis: Analyze individual variables to identify patterns and distributions.
Bivariate Analysis: Explore relationships between pairs of variables.
Multivariate Analysis: Investigate interactions between multiple variables.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, and prepare data for modeling.
Data Visualization: Visualize patterns and relationships using graphs and charts.

Model Training
After gaining insights from EDA, predictive models are trained to forecast customer churn. Commonly used machine learning algorithms for churn prediction include:

Random Forest: Ensemble learning technique that builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.

Conclusion
Customer churn analysis and prediction are essential for businesses to maintain customer satisfaction and maximize revenue. By leveraging data analytics and machine learning techniques, companies can identify at-risk customers and implement targeted retention strategies.
